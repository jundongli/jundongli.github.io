<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Jundong Li is an Assistant Professor at the University of Virginia with appointments in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Department of Computer Science, and School of Data Science. Prior to joining UVA, he received his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Arizona State University in 2019 under the supervision of Dr. <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~huanliu/">Huan Liu</a>, M.Sc. degree in Computer Science at University of Alberta in 2014, and B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering at Zhejiang University in 2012. His research interests are generally in data mining and machine learning, with a particular focus on graph machine learning, trustworthy/safe machine learning, and more recently on large language models. He has published over 150 papers in high-impact venues (including KDD, WWW, WSDM, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, IJCAI, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, SIGIR, CIKM, ICDM, SDM, ECML-PKDD, CSUR, TPAMI, TKDE, TKDD, TIST, etc), with over 12,000 citation count. He has won several prestigious awards, including SIGKDD Best Research Paper Award (2022), PAKDD Best Paper Award (2024), NSF CAREER Award (2022), PAKDD Early Career Research Award (2023), JP Morgan Chase Faculty Research Award (2021 & 2022), Cisco Faculty Research Award (2021), and being selected for the AAAI New Faculty Highlights roster (2021). His group's research is generously supported by NSF (CAREER, III, SaTC, SAI, S&CC), DOE, ONR, Commonwealth Cyber Initiative, Jefferson Lab, JP Morgan, Cisco, and Snap. </p>
